# Arduino-thermostat

If the temperature is smaller than tmin => light blue LED
If the temperature is between tmax and tmin => light green LED
If the temperature is greater than tmax => light red LED!

Parts list: Arduino, DHT11 module(in the picture I used the sensor instead of the module; if you use the sensor instead, you need a 10k resistor), RGB LED(or 3 individual LEDs), 3 X 300 ohm resistors
